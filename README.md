# ML-for-d-band-prediction
This project reproduces the results of paper written by Prof. Takigawa titled "Machine-learning prediction of the d-band center for metals and bimetals" which can be found at following link : https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ra/c6ra04345c#cit1. and builded up on that by evaluating different models with hyperparameter tuning.
Orignal data set was taken from the following literature : B. Hammer and J. K. Nørskov , Adv. Catal., 2000, 45 , 71 —129
